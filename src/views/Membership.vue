              <p>Gulfstream Sailing Club is a boater's sailing club without the yacht
              club pretense.
              </p>
              <p>If you would like to meet great people, have fun on
              boats and participate in a range of activities on the water and on
              land, then you need to join!
              </p>
              <p>If you would like to learn how to sail we have members with years of
              on and off the water boat experience. Everyone is willing to offer
              "how to information" or chat about the best places to cruise or races
              to participate in. Better still, you don't have to own a boat to join.
              If you don't know how to sail or need a refresher course, we have a
              beautiful location in Hollywood where we run a small boat sailing
              school.
              </p>
              <p>The club offers a steady diet of raft-ups, fun races, as well as
              cruising events and social activities.
              </p>
              <p>Membership costs are $140 for new members/ family and $100 annual
              renewal.
              </p>
              <p>The new members receive GSC nametags, by-laws, club roster and other
              fun items. One membership covers the whole family.
              </p>
